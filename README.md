# decision_making
Do you ever get a problems like you have too many tasks to do and can't decide what to do right now? there are several tasks you need to achieve but can't decide what to choose first.
So what this program do is first you need to input numbers of tasks you need to do. for example : reading a book, working out, go put for a ride, etc.
All you need to do is enter all the tasks and it will take a input of it in a list and they will ask you if you want to remove a task if yes then press 'y' when you enter 'y' it will randomly remove one task from the list and they will ask you to remove another again until they find out only one tas remaining in the list.
For example at last you will get : you should be doing 'a task which was remaining from the numbers of tasks you enter'
It's better to just try it yourself and see the result.
